Easily create beautiful CSS3 call-to-action buttons to use anywhere on your WordPress site.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to quickly and easily create great-looking CSS3 call-to-action buttons that can be used on any post or page in your site.

= Highlights =

* Create unlimited number of call-to-action buttons
* Buttons are built on-the-fly as you enter and select options
* Works with all modern browsers, degrades gracefully for others
* Fully CSS3 compliant with text shadowing, box shadowing, and gradients
* Color picker for unlimited color combinations
* Copy an existing button to use as starting point for others
* See your buttons on different color backgrounds
* Pre-defined defaults make getting started super easy

Use the buttons you create on your [WordPress landing pages](http://maxfoundry.com/plugins/maxlanding/), [WordPress squeeze pages](http://maxfoundry.com/plugins/maxsqueeze/), and [WordPress sales pages](http://maxfoundry.com/plugins/maxsales/) to increase your conversion rates.

And because you can create buttons to correspond to any design, this plugin is perfect for any [WordPress theme](http://maxfoundry.com/themes/).

= Samples =

To see some example buttons, check out the [MaxButtons page](http://maxfoundry.com/plugins/maxbuttons/) on the Max Foundry website.

= How To Use =

1. Click the MaxButtons page from the admin menu.
1. Click the Add New button.
1. Fill out and select the options needed to build your button.
1. Once you're ready, click Save.
1. A shortcode will be generated (ex: [maxbutton id="17"]).
1. Use the shortcode anywhere in your content.

You can also pass the button text and URL as parameters in the shortcode, giving you even greater flexibility. For example, if you want to create a set of buttons that look exactly the same, except for the text and its URL, you could do something like this:

[maxbutton id="17" text="Search with Google" url="http://google.com" ]
[maxbutton id="17" text="Search with Yahoo" url="http://yahoo.com" ]

NOTE: Using the text and URL parameters overrides those settings saved as part of the button.
