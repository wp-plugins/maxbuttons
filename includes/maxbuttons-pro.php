			<p>Everyone loves buttons, including you apparently.</p>
			
			<p>If you've created at least one button with MaxButtons, then you know what it can do: Unlimited colors. Rounded corners. Gradients. Text shadowing. Box shadowing. CSS3 that degrades gracefully.</p>
			
			<p>Those things are great, but what if it could do more? For example:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Support for two lines of text instead of just one.</li>
				<li>Packs of pre-defined buttons to use as-is or to tweak and customize as you see fit.</li>
				<li>A large selection of Google Web Fonts for beautiful typography.</li>
				<li>Import and export functionality, a huge time-saver.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Soon you can have all that and more with <strong>MaxButtons Pro</strong>.</p>
			
			<p>And for anyone using the free version of MaxButtons (you), we're offering the Pro version for <strong>HALF OFF</strong>.</p>
			
			<p>All you have to do is enter your email address below and we'll send you the discount code as soon as MaxButtons Pro is released.</p>
